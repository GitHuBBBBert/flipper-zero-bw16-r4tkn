> ⚠️ **Important Note**  
> 🔴 It **may not function properly on modern 5GHz routers/modems**, which are not vulnerable to typical deauth or beacon flood techniques due to band separation and stricter security protocols.


> ⚠️ **License & Disclaimer**  
> This software is provided "as-is" for educational and research use only. The author disclaims all liability for misuse or damage incurred from its use. Always obtain proper authorization before testing any network security tool.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

> ❗ **Compatibility Notice**  
> "It's not working on the other Flipper Zero BW16 Dev Board from Aliexpress or other store."

Some third-party BW16 dev boards (often sold on AliExpress/other marketplaces) may use different pin mappings, bootloaders, or power/level shifting that **breaks flashing or runtime behavior** with this firmware.

## ⚠️ Important Note

For those who already have an existing firmware installed on their BW16, it is recommended to erase the existing firmware first before flashing a new one. This helps avoid conflicts and ensures a clean installation.

3. **Configure Serial Port**  
   - Go to the `COM Port` section.  
   - Under `COM`, select the correct port for your connected **BW16**.  
   - Leave the rest of the settings as default.

5. **Put BW16 in Flash Mode & Start Flashing**  
   - If your BW16 is **not already in flash mode**, do the following:  
     - Hold the **BOOT** button.  
     - While holding BOOT, **press and release RESET**.  
     - Release the BOOT button.  
     - The BW16 is now in **flash mode**.  
   - Now click the `Run Upload` button to flash the firmware.
